# no-mmu-container
Container for our modified version of Keystone. Copied from their [Dockerfile](https://github.com/keystone-enclave/keystone/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile).

We tried this on macOS, but it didn't seem to work, so my project partner is now just using Ubuntu natively on an old laptop.
